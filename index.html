      Hi! My name is Petia.<br/><br/>

      I've been into software development for the past 2 years. Web is my passion and although I've still got lot to learn, I'm highly motivated to become better.

    I started learning programming in 2017. The first technologies I encountered were <strong>HTML</strong>, <strong>CSS</strong>, <strong>WordPress</strong> and <strong>C#</strong>. After the course I managed to create my first <a href="https://www.autoelectronicselectra.com/en/">my first web site</a>. Even though it's not quite good looking, with it I gained some valuable skills:
    <ul>
      <li><strong>think about what features should a product have</strong>,</li>
      <li><strong>deploy a product in a production environment (Linode)</strong>,</li>
      <li><strong>manage my priorities during development</strong>.</li>
    </ul>

    I also used this product to learn <strong>Django</strong> and <strong>Python</strong>.
    </p>

    Next, I joined the <a href="volontime.com">volontime.com</a> team. There I was responsible for fixing bugs, <strong>writing and refactoring the tests</strong> for the codebase and developing new features. My <strong>most notable contribution</strong> was a video popup which showed whenever a new user has been logged in.

    During my time there I also learned the following:
    <ul>
      <li><strong>how to collaborate in a team</strong>,</li>
      <li><strong>what it's like to be part of a product which is constantly in development</strong>,</li>
      <li><strong>node.js as a backend technology</strong>,</li>
      <li><strong>Angular IO as a frontend technology</strong>,</li>
      <li><strong>a bit of PostgreSQL for data storage</strong>.</li>
    </ul>
    </p>

    Next, I created the <a href="https://sindikatohrana.org/bg/">sindikatohrana.org</a> using again <strong>Python</strong> and <strong>Django</strong>.
    </p>

    My last endeavour was as an intern for a company which developed a medical ERP system. There I was responsible for writing frontend tests using TestCafe. The team and the project were a lot bigger than my previous experiences.

    I just started designing my company website where my goal is to include an online store as well. There I'll use
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Python + Django as a backend technology</strong>,</li>
      <li><strong>React as a frontend technology</strong>.</li>
    </ul>
    You can find out more about my new venture <a href="https://github.com/scallopy/GR">Here</a>.
