      <h3>Hi! My name is Petya.</h3>

    During my career so far I have been more involved in my own small business, mainly in the field of retail. I was interested in computer programs and their us–µ for business support. I learned about different areas of business and what I need to do to make their work more efficient and easy through computer programs, online presence and advertising.
    </p>

    <p>
    I had an idea to make an application in support of a specific area
    of the economy, giving the opportunity to beginners and small
    entrepreneurs in this area to have the opportunity to increase their presence in the web space.
    </p>

    <p>
    While working with programming languages I found that Python is my favorite programming
    language and I prefere to work with Python and its frameworks like Django or Flask. I decided
    to improve my Python knowledge. I did that with <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/">
      Codecademy</a>, because there I found a lot of practical tasks
    and I could practice what I learned. There I got certificates for Python3, Intermediate Python and Computer Science.

    <h3>About my Career Path:</h3>

    <p>
    In 2014 I started to learn English language. I was working and in my free time I was studying.
    </p>
    <p>
    In 2017 I started a basic programming course at a Bulgarian-German center for professional development.
    </p>

    <p>
    The first technologies I encountered there were <strong>HTML</strong>, <strong>CSS</strong>, <strong>WordPress</strong> and <strong>C#</strong>. After the course I managed to create my first <a href="https://www.autoelectronicselectra.com/en/">web site</a>. Even though it's not quite good looking, with it I gained some valuable skills:
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Think about what features should a product have.</strong>,</li>
      <li><strong>Deploy a product in a production environment (Linode).</strong>,</li>
      <li><strong>Manage my priorities during development.</strong>.</li>
    </ul>

    I also used this product to learn <strong>Django</strong> and <strong>Python</strong>.
    </p>

    <hr />

    <p>
    Next, I joined the <a href="volontime.com">volontime.com</a> team. There I was responsible for fixing bugs, <strong>writing and refactoring the tests</strong> for the codebase and developing new features. My <strong>most notable contribution</strong> was a video popup which showed whenever a new user has been logged in.

    During my time there I also learned the following:
    <ul>
      <li><strong>How to collaborate in a team.</strong>,</li>
      <li><strong>What it's like to be part of a product which is constantly in development.</strong>,</li>
      <li><strong>Node.js as a backend technology.</strong></li>
      <li><strong>Angular IO as a frontend technology.</strong></li>
      <li><strong>A bit of PostgreSQL for data storage</strong>.</li>
    </ul>
    </p>

    <hr />

    <p>
    Next, I created the <a href="https://sindikatohrana.org/bg/">sindikatohrana.org</a> using again <strong>Python</strong> and <strong>Django</strong>.
    </p>

    <hr />

    <p>
    After that I was as an intern for a company which developed a medical ERP system. There I was responsible for writing frontend tests using TestCafe. The team and the project were a lot bigger than my previous experiences.
    </p>

    <hr />

    <p>
    I started designing my company website where my goal is to include an online store as well. There I'll use:
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Python + Django as a backend technology</strong>,</li>
      <li><strong>I make a basic app:</strong><br>
      I make a basic application that in the beginning can work as a catalog of products from different areas of consumption. Cards with all types of available products, arranged by minus id, appear as a home page. Through the admin panel I made it possible to create different types of stores, which are then displayed in the main menu. In each store, the products are classified by category and will be displayed in alphabetical order to facilitate the search.
      </li>
      <li><strong>Deploy my app on the production server. It will work like a server side rendering application.</strong></li>
      <li><strong>Develop the necessary futures to make my app work effectively.</strong></li>
      <li><strong>Make:</strong>
        <ul>
        <li><strong>Translation;</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Implement Django Rest Framework to implement there React or Angular for frontend;</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Experiment with a few kind of authentications;</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Include Ansible, try to configure automated deploy and automated SSL certificate renewation.</strong></li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
    </p>
