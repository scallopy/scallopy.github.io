    During my career so far I have been more involved in my own small business, mainly in the field of retail. I was interested in computer programs and their usе for business support. I learned about different areas of business and what I need to do to make their work more efficient and easy through computer programs, online presence and advertising.
    </p>

    <p>
    I had an idea to make an application in support of a specific area of ​​the economy, giving the opportunity to beginners and small entrepreneurs in this area:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>to be able to publish advertisements for materials and consumables necessary for the work of the people engaged in this activity;</li>
      <li>be able to become acquainted with the legal provisions relating to them;</li>
      <li>the application should contain a list and possibility for contact with legal entities and foundations that work in support of this activity;</li>
      <li>to have a library where everyone can publish innovations and help articles for those wishing to gain new knowledge;</li>
      <li>to have contact with potential wholesalers who are involved in the distribution of their products;</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
    Then I start to learn and improve my knowledge. First of all, I'm starting to learn English. I was working and in my free time I was studying.
    </p>
    <p>
    I began a course of basic programming.
    </p>

    <p>
    The first technologies I encountered there were <strong>HTML</strong>, <strong>CSS</strong>, <strong>WordPress</strong> and <strong>C#</strong>. After the course I managed to create my first <a href="https://www.autoelectronicselectra.com/en/">web site</a>. Even though it's not quite good looking, with it I gained some valuable skills:
    <ul>
      <li><strong>think about what features should a product have</strong>,</li>
      <li><strong>deploy a product in a production environment (Linode)</strong>,</li>
      <li><strong>manage my priorities during development</strong>.</li>
    </ul>

    I also used this product to learn <strong>Django</strong> and <strong>Python</strong>.
    </p>

    <p>
    Next, I joined the <a href="volontime.com">volontime.com</a> team. There I was responsible for fixing bugs, <strong>writing and refactoring the tests</strong> for the codebase and developing new features. My <strong>most notable contribution</strong> was a video popup which showed whenever a new user has been logged in.

    During my time there I also learned the following:
    <ul>
      <li><strong>how to collaborate in a team</strong>,</li>
      <li><strong>what it's like to be part of a product which is constantly in development</strong>,</li>
      <li><strong>node.js as a backend technology</strong>,</li>
      <li><strong>Angular IO as a frontend technology</strong>,</li>
      <li><strong>a bit of PostgreSQL for data storage</strong>.</li>
    </ul>
    </p>

    <hr />

    <p>
    Next, I created the <a href="https://sindikatohrana.org/bg/">sindikatohrana.org</a> using again <strong>Python</strong> and <strong>Django</strong>.
    </p>

    <hr />

    <p>
    After that I was as an intern for a company which developed a medical ERP system. There I was responsible for writing frontend tests using TestCafe. The team and the project were a lot bigger than my previous experiences.
    </p>

    <hr />

    <p>
    I started designing my company website where my goal is to include an online store as well. There I'll use:
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Python + Django as a backend technology</strong>,</li>
      <li><strong>I will make the basic app:</strong><br>
      I make a basic application that in the beginning can work as a catalog of products from different areas of consumption. Cards with all types of available products, arranged by minus id, appear as a home page. Through the admin panel I made it possible to create different types of stores, which are then displayed in the main menu. In each store, the products are classified by category and will be displayed in alphabetical order to facilitate the search.
      </li>
      <li><strong>Then I will deploy my app on the production server. It will work like a server side rendering application.</strong></li>
      <li><strong>After that I will start to develop the necessary futures to make my app work effectively.</strong></li>
      <li><strong>I will make:</strong>
        <ul>
        <li><strong>Translation;</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Implement Django Rest Framework to implement there React or Angular for frontend;</strong></li>
        <li><strong>I will experiment with a few kind of authentications;</strong></li>
        <li><strong>I will include Ansible, I will try to configure automated deploy and automated SSL certificate renewation.</strong></li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
    </p>
